# üìò SQL JOINs Explained: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER

In relational databases, data is often split across multiple tables. To extract meaningful insights, you frequently need to **combine data from two or more tables** ‚Äî this is where SQL JOINs come in.

---

## üîπ What is a JOIN?

A `JOIN` in SQL combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column (typically a primary-foreign key relationship). The resulting dataset will vary depending on the type of JOIN used.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN

### ‚úÖ Definition:

Returns **only the rows that have matching values** in both tables.

### üîß Syntax:

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### üìò Example:

Join `customers` and `orders` tables to get customers who have placed an order.

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### ‚úÖ Key Points:

* Filters out unmatched records.
* Most commonly used JOIN type.
* Results will **exclude customers with no orders**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)

### ‚úÖ Definition:

Returns **all rows from the left table**, and matched rows from the right table.
If there's no match, NULLs are returned for columns from the right table.

### üîß Syntax:

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### üìò Example:

List all customers and their orders (if any).

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### ‚úÖ Key Points:

* Ensures all records from the **left table** are included.
* Use when you want to identify unmatched records (e.g., customers with **no orders**).

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

### ‚úÖ Definition:

Returns **all rows from the right table**, and matched rows from the left table.
If there's no match, NULLs are returned for columns from the left table.

### üîß Syntax:

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### üìò Example:

List all orders and the customer who placed them.
Even if the customer record no longer exists, the order will appear.

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### ‚úÖ Key Points:

* Useful for keeping **all right-side data**, even if there's no corresponding left-side entry.
* Good for auditing orphan records (e.g., deleted customers with remaining orders).

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ FULL OUTER JOIN

### ‚úÖ Definition:

Returns **all rows from both tables**.
Where no match exists, NULLs are returned in place.

### üîß Syntax:

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### üìò Example:

List all customers and all orders, matching where possible.

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### ‚úÖ Key Points:

* Useful for **comprehensive comparison**.
* Highlights unmatched rows from both tables.
* May not be supported in some DBs (like MySQL) ‚Äî in such cases, use `UNION` of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.

## üßæ Summary of JOIN Types

| JOIN Type         | Returns                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INNER JOIN`      | Only matching rows in both tables                               |
| `LEFT JOIN`       | All rows from the left table, matched rows from the right table |
| `RIGHT JOIN`      | All rows from the right table, matched rows from the left table |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN` | All rows from both tables, matched where possible               |

## üí° Pro Tips

* Always use **table aliases** (`c`, `o`) for clarity in multi-table queries.
* Combine JOINs with `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` for advanced queries.
* For **performance**, ensure join columns are indexed ‚Äî especially in large datasets.
